# üáÆüá≥ Indian Army Database Management System (Final SQL Project)

## üìò Project Overview
This project is a **comprehensive SQL-based database management system** that models the structure and operations of the **Indian Army**.  
It includes the creation of multiple interrelated tables, complex SQL operations, and advanced features like **joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures, triggers, and transactions**.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate mastery of **SQL concepts** by implementing a realistic, large-scale database with relationships, integrity constraints, and operational logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### üß± Database Design
- Realistic tables for **officers, soldiers, battalions, missions, weapons, payroll, and records**.
- Relationships modeled using **primary keys, foreign keys**, and **constraints**.
- Includes **CHECK**, **DEFAULT**, **UNIQUE**, **CASCADE**, and **ON UPDATE** operations.

### üíæ CRUD Operations
- Full coverage of **CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE** commands.  
- Insertion of realistic military data for officers, soldiers, and weapons.

### üß© Joins & Relationships
- **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, **CROSS JOIN**, and **SELF JOIN** examples.  
- Demonstrates linking of battalions, soldiers, missions, and weapon data.

### üß† Subqueries & Clauses
- Single-row, multi-row, correlated, and nested subqueries.  
- Practical use of **WHERE**, **LIKE**, **IN**, **ANY**, **ALL**, and **EXISTS** conditions.

### üìä Views & CTEs
- Multiple **views** to simplify complex queries (e.g., `HighRankingOfficers`, `BattalionArmaments`).  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** and **Recursive CTEs** for hierarchy and reporting.

### üîÑ Stored Procedures
- CRUD-based procedures for soldiers, officers, and missions:
  - `AddNewSoldier()`
  - `GetOfficerDetails()`
  - `UpdateSoldierLocation()`
  - `DeleteMission()`

### üîê Triggers & Transactions
- Audit log implemented using **AFTER INSERT**, **BEFORE UPDATE**, and **AFTER DELETE** triggers.
- Safe data modification through **COMMIT**, **ROLLBACK**, and **SAVEPOINT** transactions.
- Demonstrates database auditing and rollback control.
